            <ol>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce.</li>
                        <li>Trim and quarter zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick pieces. Peel and mince garlic. Zest and quarter lemon.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain. (Keep empty pot handy for step 5.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            While pasta cooks, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add zucchini; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 4-6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. Wipe out pan.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meanwhile, pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with Italian Seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
                        <li>Once zucchini is done, heat a large drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side.</li>
                        <li>Turn off heat; transfer to a cutting board to rest</li>
                        <li>Once cool enough to handle, slice chicken crosswise.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heat a drizzle of olive oil in pot used for spaghetti over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Add garlic, half the lemon zest, and a pinch of chili flakes. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 20-30 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Stir in ½ cup reserved pasta cooking water (¾ cup for 4 servings), stock concentrate, and juice from two lemon wedges (four wedges for 4).</li>
                        <li>Simmer until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Add drained spaghetti, zucchini, sour cream, and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) to pot with sauce; toss to coat.</li>
                        <li>Add half the Parmesan and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                        <li>TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until spaghetti is coated in a creamy sauce.</li>
                        <li>
                            Divide pasta between bowls. 
                            Top with chicken, remaining Parmesan, remaining lemon zest, and a pinch of chili flakes if desired. 
                            Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.

            <h3>Recipe Websites</h3>
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/283432/everything-salmon-sheet-pan-dinner/">AllRecipes</a>
            <p>This website has multiple levels, so there are many links and hyperlinks to different pages that might be referenced.
                There's a social aspect of showing user reviews/ratings and a how-to video by the poster.
                However, there are a lot of popups and different elements that can make the screen feel cluttered and the experience less user-friendly.
            </p>

            <p>
                It doesn't adapt very well to change in window size. The video is optional to view, so it doesn't immediately start playing and crowd the user.
                The layout of the actual ingredients and instructions is very clean and simple to navigate.
                There are many icons used that make navigating buttons and links easier.

                Thumbnail image displaying food item is close-up but not as visually-appealing as other websites, quality of images is also varied.
                The only thing immediately displayed on the recipe page is the recipe name, ratings, quick stats, and ingredients.
                Instead of immediately displaying instructions, there a button to "read directions", which leaves the screen feeling less crowded, but it personally took me longer to realize.
                There are more nutrition facts displayed than the usual recipe website.
