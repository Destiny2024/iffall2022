        <div class="lyric">
            <p>So where are you? It's been a little while</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Sippin' on straight chlorine,</p>
            <p>Let the vibes slide over me</p>
            <p>This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical</p>
            <p>When I leave don't save my seat,</p>
            <p>I'll be back when it's all complete</p>
            <p>The moment is medical, moment is medical</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Loving what I'm tasting,</p>
            <p>Venom on my tongue,</p>
            <p>Dependent at times.</p>
            <p>Poisonous vibrations,</p>
            <p>Help my body run,</p>
            <p>I'm running for my life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Fall out of formation,</p>
            <p>I plan my escape, </p>
            <p>From walls they confined.</p>
            <p>Rebel red carnation,</p>
            <p>Grows while I decay,</p>
            <p>I'm running for my life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lyric">
            <p>Hide you in my coat pocket,</p>
            <p>Where I kept my rebel red,</p>
            <p>I felt I was invincible,</p>
            <p>You wrapped around my head,</p>
            <p>Now different lives I lead,</p>
            <p>My body lives on lead,</p>
            <p>The last two lines may read,</p>
            <p>Incorrect until said,</p>
            <p>The lead is terrible in flavor,</p>
            <p>But now you double as a paper maker,</p>
            <p>I despise you sometimes,</p>
            <p>I love to hate the fight,</p>
            <p>And you in my life is like...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lyric">
            <p>I'm so sorry I forgot you,</p>
            <p>Let me catch you up to speed,</p>
            <p>I've been tested like the ends of,</p>
            <p>A weathered flag that's by the sea.</p>
            <p>Can you build my house with pieces?</p>
            <p>I'm just a chemical.</p>
